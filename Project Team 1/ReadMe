Case Study on Spotify Data: Trend Analysis: Analyze how the audio features of a specific artist have evolved over time.
We will be analyzing the trends in tempo, loudness, or other musical attributes using Python and importing the Spotipy package to
retrieve the real-time data through the Spotify API. We are planning to use MySQL to persist the data that has evolved over time.
