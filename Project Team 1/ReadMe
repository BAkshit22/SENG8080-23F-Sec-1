# Case Study on Spotify Data - Trend Analysis
Analyze how the audio features of a specific artist have evolved over time.
We will be analyzing the trends in tempo, loudness, or other musical attributes using Python and importing the Spotipy package to
retrieve the real-time data through the Spotify API. We are planning to use MySQL to persist the data that has evolved over time.

Prerequisites

1. Install the Spotify package
 ```bash
 pip3 install spotipy
 ```
2.  Create or Login to an account in Spotify Marketplace using your Visual Studio Code IDE

3. Login in to Spotify Developers Community and Create an App using the App Name and Redirect URL In order to get the Client Credentials

Installation

1. Create the Mysql database
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE case_study_spotify_db"
```
With Following Credentials:
```bash
DATABASE_NAME = "case_study_spotify_db"
MYSQL_USERNAME = "root"
MYSQL_HOST = "localhost"
MYSQL_PASSWORD = "password"
```

Execution

1. Use the Spotify credentials in your Python Program to establish the connection successfully to fetch the track records based on musical attributes.
	
2. Run the python file
```bash
python CaseStudy-Spotify.py
```
